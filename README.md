==================
IGME-590 iOS & tvOS Game Development - Project 1

#### I. High Concept
> Geometry Wars, except you teleport to wherever you touch! Then, flick and release in a direction to fire at enemies.

#### II. Genre
- Arcade

#### III. Platform
- iPad ONLY

#### IV. Story
- Theme - Space Shooter reminiscent of Geometry Wars
- Mood - Fast-paced Excitement
- Narrative - Endless enemy waves
- Premise - "You're the last surviving ship of your fleet. With the enemy's prized space-time warper technology now in your hands, it's time to pay them back!"

#### V. Esthetics
- Graphics Style - Abstract or Cartoonish, whichever we find better sprites for
- Sound (8-bit or techno) - Sounds for: UI, background, firing, enemy ship defeat, wave number or additional enemies inbound indication

#### VI. Gameplay
###### Mechanics
- Whenever a player taps on the screen, the player's spaceship will move instantaneously to the point where the player touches
- Dragging directly after tapping will start continuous rapid fire in the direction the finger is dragged to.
- Players lose life when an enemy makes contact with their spaceship
- Player will gain points for destroying enemies
- Enemies will spawn from any and all sides moving towards the player at random speed
- Enemies spawn in successive waves, with each wave containing more than the last. Players do not encounter enemies of the next wave until the current one is finished.

###### Control
- Touch & Gesture only

###### Teaching the game / New user / Onboarding
- One-panel instruction screen that shows up before entering the first wave. Player should be able to pick up the game easily.

###### Player learning
- Players will have to learn to timing and aiming skills in order to move to safe locations to avoid and kill enemies.
- Traditional enemies in Geometry Wars were effective due to the fact that players were required to move around them. With teleportation, players can much more easily avoid those types of enemties

#### VII. Screenshots
- TBA

#### VIII. Other
- N/A
