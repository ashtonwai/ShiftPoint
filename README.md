#### VI. Gameplay
###### Mechanics
- A shooting point will be set at the point where the player touches, and dragging from that point will start shooting to the direction that it is being dragged to.
- Player touching a new point will set the shooting point at the new location and remove the previous point.
- Enemy hitting the shooting point will decrease the players life.
- Player will gain points for destroying enemies.
- Enemies will spon from all four edges moving towards the player with random speed.
- Bombs will start growing at the play location with a timer to prevent player from staying in the same location for too long.

###### Control
- Touch

###### Teaching the game / New user
- One-panel instruction screen that shows up before playing the first level. Player should be able to pick up the game easily.

###### Player learning
